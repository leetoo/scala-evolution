Inspired by [The Evolution of a Haskell Programmer](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~cannata/cs345/Class%20Notes/10%20Haskell%20Programmer%20Evolution.html)

17 different ways to write a program that calculates factorial based on user input.

- `akkadev`: using Akka framework (https://akka.io).
- `almostfp`: a person making his first attemps in FP.
- `apofutuhylo`: using apomorphism, futumorphism and hylomorphism recursion schemes.
- `beginner`: a person making his first steps in Scala.
- `cake`: Scala's Cake pattern.
- `fixcombinator`: factorial using Y-combinator.
- `freemonad`: program as ADTs interpreted into a target monad.
- `freemonadfreek`: similar to `freemonad` but using `freek` library for reduce lifting boilerplate.
- `javadev`: \*cough\*
- `johndegoes`: concurrent factorial and effects composition using ZIO (https://zio.dev).
- `paramorphism`: factorial using paramorphism recursion scheme.
- `peanoadt`: factorial encoded in peano numbers as ADTs.
- `peanotypes`: type level version of `peanoadt`.
- `shapeless`: type level factorial using Shapeless (https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless).
- `spakdev`: spark developer take on the factorial problem.
- `taglessfinal`: tagless final encoding for effects composition.
- `trampoline`: factorial using trampolining technique.
